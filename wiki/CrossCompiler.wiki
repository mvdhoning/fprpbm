#summary How to make a FreePascal cross compiler for use with the Raspberry Pi.

= Introduction =

To use FreePascal for bare metal programming on the Raspberry Pi we first need a FreePascal cross compiler.


= Details =

 * download and install freepascal version 2.6.0 in your home folder 
 * download and install arm compiler as used in: http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/freshers/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/ok01.html
 * add the following bin folder on your path
  * export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/fpc-2.6.0/bin
  * export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/arm-2008q3/bin
 * in the freepascal bin folder copy pp386 to ppcppc
 * download the freepascal 2.6.0 sources
 * make the cross compiler be executing the following command
  * make crossinstall CPU_TARGET=arm OS_TARGET=linux CROSSBINDIR=~/arm-2008q3/bin OPT=-dFPC_ARMEL INSTALL_PREFIX=~/build NOGDB=1 BINUTILSPREFIX=arm-none-eabi-
 * copy the ppccrossarm from the build folder as ppcarm in the freepascal bin folder
